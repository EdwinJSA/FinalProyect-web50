# FinalProyect-web50

>This project consists of a web application which keeps track of the sales, inventory, products, categories and suppliers of a real pharmacy, called "Farmacia Cristal". This is a beta version, as the customer has not yet arranged all the requirements, i.e. it is still in the development stage, but it can be attributed that the initial concept of the system was completed in its entirety.
